## About the app
This application gets transactions from a API and identifies unique product ids showing a list of products.
If one item is selected, a detail from the product with a list of it transactions will be displayed.
All transactions amounts are converted to euros and a total amount will be displayed as well.

API Server gives random results, so displayed products can be different each time.

Also, Iâ€™ve decided to set API 30 as targetsdkversion and follow google recommendations choosing API 23 as minsdkversion.

## Requeriments
  - [X] Download information when app starts
  - [X] Show list of products
  - [X] Show a detail view with product transactions with amount transformed into EURO and the total amount of all transactions
  - [X] Don't block the UI

## Extra Points
  - [ ] Try not to use floating point numbers (I had issues with Moshi adapter and BigDecimal)
  - [X] Use Banker's rounding in amounts
  - [X] Use headers instead of file extensions in API Request
